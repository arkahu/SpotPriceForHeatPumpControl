REQUIREMENTS:

USAGE:
Use cron or any other scheduling program to run SpotPriceGet.py once per day before midnight
and HeatPumpControl.py at beginning of every hour. Note that prices should be fetched only 
after the last run of control program. Write the desired pump commands to the Settings.txt 
file, into levels. Make sure the hours.txt and log.txt have write permissions.

You may also write the hours.txt manually to use fixed clock based control.
